DO NOT USE THIS WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER! There is still a chance to get banned for Cheats(autoclicker).


# autoclicker-ruleta-blue.bugged.ro
Requirements: 
1. Resolution 1920x1080 (Fullscreen, Borderless, or Windowed Maximized)
2. Open 'settings.txt' and set these: time in seconds, bet, color(red, black, green is dangerous), pc username(to be able to acces your SAMP folder), nickname
3. If there was a message in the chat (not from players, from giftbox, betting etc) which starts with "You won" you must delete your 'chatlog' first.
4. Being Alt+Tab might be dangerous, your mouse will click anyway when the roulette stops spining on the main monitor.
5. I suggest using a dual monitor setup to be able to see the 'Last'.
6. The autoclicker usually works when you are on Windowed if you maximize the 'GTA:SA' tab. If not, try turning on the setting from Windows to hide the taskbar.
7. Do not set big a big value for the 'bet', it's risky, be careful with your budget.
8. To STOP the program you can type macarena in chat, it might bet once before stopping, or just bug itself and never stop :)).
9. This program isn't supposed to make you rich in 2 bets, it just uses a simple mathematical algorithm to keep you on profit.
10. You can watch Netflix on the other monitor, if you're rich enough to have one.

There might be something I forgot, but I guess you'll find out how to fix it yourselves, the source code is there.
